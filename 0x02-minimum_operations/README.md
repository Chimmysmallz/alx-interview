# Copy and Paste H's
This is a Python function that calculates the minimum number of operations needed to produce exactly n H's in a text file using the "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Usage
The function minOperations(n) takes one integer argument n and returns the minimum number of operations needed to produce exactly n H's. If n is impossible to achieve (i.e., it's odd), the function returns 0.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

python
Copy code
from copy_and_paste_hs import minOperations

n = 9
num_ops = minOperations(n)
print(f"Number of operations to get {n} H's: {num_ops}")
This will output: "Number of operations to get 9 H's: 6".

## Algorithm
The algorithm works as follows:

If n is odd, return 0 (it's impossible to reach that number).
Start with two H's and set count to 0.
While the number of H's we have is less than n:
If the number of H's we have is a multiple of 2 (i.e., we can "copy all" and double the number of H's), do that and add 2 to count.
Otherwise, "paste" one H and add 1 to count.
If we have exactly n H's, add 2 to count (to "copy all" and paste).
Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), since we double the number of H's we have at each iteration of the loop. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.
