# Pascal's Triangle
This program generates the Pascal's triangle of a given size n.

## Description
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It has a rich structure and properties, including that its diagonals contain the natural numbers, the sum of the elements in each row is a power of 2, and its rows can be used to generate the coefficients of the binomial expansion.

The program takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of size n. If n is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Python 3.6 or higher

## Installing
* Clone the repository to your local machine

## Executing program
* Run the program by executing the command python3 pascal_triangle.py
* Enter a positive integer n when prompted
* The program will output the Pascal's triangle of size n

### Example:
$ python3 pascal_triangle.py
Enter a positive integer n: 5
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
